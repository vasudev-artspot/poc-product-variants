Title:
Make react image upload component easier with react-images-uploading and your UI


Intro Text:
Hello everyone. Like the title I named above, this is a post I want to introduce my first public React component on Npm. I hope it will save your time because it saves my time (but after I take the time to try to write it lol).


Image Upload

Introduction


Description content:
React-images-uploading is a react component with just logic code helping select image(s) to show on UI and preparing to upload. Just logic code means no UI, no CSS and depends on your UI.

This module was born for resolving my working task absolutely. Before I code it I have researched some image upload components, and realize that almost all have logic and UI already. It is good if you just make a baby project for fun and do not (or a little bit) care about the UI. But in my working, I have to refer to the design, and other components force me to override CSS. So I make my module as abstract as possible.
